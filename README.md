joint ROom Parameter Estimatior (jROPE) in Matlab (better under Linux) script

This script is a Matlab script 

        run.m 

to apply ROPE approach for blind room parameter estimation directly from single-channel reverberant and noisy speech. Note that current version (v0.1) still depends on Kaldi toolkit (https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi) which is used here to forward-pass the trained neural network. Please follow the Kaldi introuction to install the necessary binaries.
